# xmlgraph
Renders "autodoc" graph image from XML file

Writing documentation for XML formats is pain. This utility
renders a graph from a given XML file, which graph contains 
the most important attributes and nodes (can be adjusted). 
This image can be used as the documentation of the XML file.

Requires PHP and GraphViz.
This utility is written in 2009 but released years later.
